# Gilded Rose

Another practice tech test for Week 10 at Makers, this time dealing with refactoring and extending legacy code. I'll be using a Ruby translation by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/ruby/gilded_rose.rb), working according to [these instructions](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/individual_challenges/gilded_rose.md).
